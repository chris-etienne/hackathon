# 2018 Kickoff: Hackathon Event

## Preparation for the Hackathon

### I. Software Installation
#### [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
For at least a portion of the hackathon, you will be using [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/).  The preferred IDE for Scala is [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).  It would be best if you use the ultimate edition.  While this requires a subscription, you can get a trial edition of the software for 30 days.
#### [Visual Studio Code](http://https://code.visualstudio.com) with [Graphviz](./doc/GraphViz.md) extention
We'll use an extension for Visual Studio Code to assist us in our designs.  This extension allows Visual Studio Code to interpret the [DOT language](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/doc/info/lang.html).  You may find the [dotguide] (http://www.graphviz.org/pdf/dotguide.pdf) is useful to you.
##### Installing Graphviz - follow these instructions provided [here.](./doc/GraphViz.md)


### II. Accounts you need to setup 
##### if you dont already have these associated with your @numerix.com email address

#### A. Set up a [Github](http://www.github.com) account
Please create a github account for yourself.  Once you have created that account, please send me a quick note on Slack that shares your github user name with me.
> **Notes on the use of GitHub:**  You may find it odd that I am recommending that you get a GitHub account when, as a company, we use BitBucket.  

##### i.  Make sure that you secure Github, by [setting up an ssh key](/doc/setting-up-ssh-windows.md)
You should probably set up an ssh key rather than using HTTPS authentication.  The above link provides the steps you'll need to follow if you don't already know how to do this.

#### B.  Get a [Slack](https://www.slack.com) account
We will use a specially created slack workspace called [nx-hackathon.slack.com](https://nx-hackathon.slack.com) for this event.
