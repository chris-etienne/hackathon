# 2018 Kickoff: Hackathon Event

## Preparation for the Hackathon

### I. Software Installation
#### [Intellij](http://mdp.tylingsoft.com/)
For at least a portion of the hackathon, you will be using Scala.  The preferred IDE for Scala is Intellij.  It would be best if you use the ultimate edition.  While this requires a subscription, you can get a trial edition of the software for 30 days.
#### [Visual Studio Code](http://https://code.visualstudio.com) with [Graphviz](./doc/GraphViz.md) extention
We'll use an extension for Visual Studio Code to assist us in our designs.  This extension allows Visual Studio Code to interpret the [DOT lanaguage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_graph_description_language).

[Instructions to install](./doc/GraphViz.md)


### II. Accounts you need to setup 
##### if you dont already have these associated with your @numerix.com email address

#### [Github](http://www.github.com)
Please create a github account for yourself.  Once you have created that account, please send me a quick note on Slack that shares your github user name with me.
> **Notes on the use of GitHub:**  You may find it odd that I am recommending that you get a GitHub account when, as a company, we use BitBucket.  

##### Securing Github
###### [Set up an ssh key](/docs/setting-up-ssh-windows.md)



#### [Slack](https://www.slack.com)
We will use a specially created slack workspace called [nx-hackathon.slack.com](https://nx-hackathon.slack.com) for this event.
