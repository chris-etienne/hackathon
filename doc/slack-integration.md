# Hooking up Slack to GitHub or Bitbucket

One of the nice things about a platform like Slack is that you can use bots.  A bot that I like to use in my slack workspace is the GitHub bot.

What this bot does is notify members of a channel when a github (or bitbucket) commit, pull request and other activity happens.

## How to install the GitHub bot in Slack:

### Install the GitHub app from the [Slack App Directory](https://nx-hackathon.slack.com/apps)

##### Note:  You wont be able to do this in the hack-a-thon workspace because of permissions.  You can do this in a personal workspace or if you have admin/owner rights to a workspace.   The point here is to show that this kind of automation can be done relatively easily

This is the slack resources page

#### From there, we will select the github app and configure authentication:

#### Then we pick the channel to post to:

You can then select what information you want the bot to post to your channel:
