# Using .g8 Templates for Quick Scaffolding

[Giter8](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8) is a command line tool to generate files and directories from templates published on Github or any other git repository. Itâ€™s implemented in Scala and runs through the sbt launcher, but it can produce output for any purpose.

## Requirements
### SBT (Simple Build Tool) must be installed.
sbt is a build tool for Scala and Java.  It requires Java 1.8 or later.
#### Installing SBT
##### Windows
The easiest way to do this is to use the [Windows Installer](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/download/v1.1.0/sbt-1.1.0.1.msi)

##### Mac
Use homebrew:

```
brew install sbt@1
```

##### Linux
```
echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian /" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sbt
```

## Getting Started

### Creating your First Scala Project Using .g8 Templates

Create a directory called ~/kickoff/hackathon-2018/scala/

```
droach at macbook-13 in ~/kickoff
$ mkdir hackathon-2018
droach at macbook-13 in ~/kickoff
$ ls
hackathon      hackathon-2018 site           target
droach at macbook-13 in ~/kickoff
$ cd hackathon-2018
droach at macbook-13 in ~/kickoff/hackathon-2018
$ cd scala
droach at macbook-13 in ~/kickoff/hackathon-2018/scala
$ sbt new sbt/scala-seed.g8
WARN: No sbt.version set in project/build.properties, base directory: /Users/droach/kickoff/hackathon-2018/scala

[info] Set current project to scala (in build file:/Users/droach/kickoff/hackathon-2018/scala/)

A minimal Scala project.

name [Scala Seed Project]: hello-world

Template applied in ./hello-world
```


You should now see the hello-world and target directories
```
droach at macbook-13 in ~/kickoff/hackathon-2018/scala
$ ls
hello-world target
```
Change directory to hello-world and you will see a build.sbt file.
```
droach at macbook-13 in ~/kickoff/hackathon-2018/scala
$ cd hello-world
droach at macbook-13 in ~/kickoff/hackathon-2018/scala/hello-world
$ ls
build.sbt project   src
```
From here you can use sbt to compile and run the new project.  When you compile for the first time, it will download a bunch of necessary artifacts and update the projects dependencies.  It will then compile.

```
sbt compile

```

When the project is done compiling, you can:

 ``` sbt run ```

If all goes well, you'll see this:
